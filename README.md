# Hi, I'm Jimin Park

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who enjoys building practical, reliable ML systems. Most of my work sits at the intersection of data engineering, model development, and deployment — making sure things not only work, but work consistently at scale.

I’ve worked across AI governance, public R&D analytics, and ML infrastructure, and I’m especially interested in evaluation pipelines, LLM systems, and lightweight models for edge devices.

-

## What I Do

- Build end-to-end ML workflows: data pipelines, training, evaluation, deployment  
- Work with large datasets (PySpark, SQL) and production ML systems  
- Design model evaluation and compliance pipelines  
- Explore TinyML and efficient model architectures

## Experience

**IBM VSIP — Machine Learning Engineer Intern**  
Built compliance-to-policy plugins and automated evaluation pipelines. Containerized governance modules to streamline deployment and reduce false positives.

**KIST — Machine Learning Engineer**  
Designed PySpark pipelines over multi-million-record datasets with high recall. Integrated NLP models into CI/CD dashboards and published first-author research.

**KISTEP — Machine Learning Engineer**  
Automated funding review workflows and improved forecasting systems with faster, cleaner data pipelines.

**KIPF & KIET — Machine Learning Engineer / Intern**  
Developed ETL pipelines, integrated large fiscal datasets, and built real-time dashboards for government analytics.
